First of all you need to create a static nested class and then copy all the arguments from the outer class
 to the Builder class. We should follow the naming convention and if the class name is Computer then
 builder class should be named as ComputerBuilder.

The Builder class should have a public constructor with all the required attributes as parameters.
Builder class should have methods to set the optional parameters and it should return the same Builder
object after setting the optional attribute.

The final step is to provide a build() method in the builder class that will return the Object needed
by client program. For this we need to have a private constructor in the Class with Builder class as argument.
